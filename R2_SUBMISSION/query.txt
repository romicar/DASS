1> About secondaryTechnique - it is a multivalued attribute

2> Duration & SilenceLevel - It was first designed to be visible when
 nothing is created for specific duration and silenceLevel but later on 
 in last update Samvid sir told us to invert how opacity works there.
 Though, will increase opacity.

3> Duration Range & Silence Range - It has to be added manually in airtable to show up as stated,
    'Audio Duration' and 'silenceDuration' fields should be filled up, 'silenceDuration' field
    is empty in airtable.
